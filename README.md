CS 405: Secure Coding Portfolio

This repository contains my complete work for CS 405: Secure Coding at Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout the course, I worked on a series of projects, activities, and reflections that focused on developing secure software practices in C++. The assignments challenged me to identify risks, mitigate vulnerabilities, and apply secure coding principles consistently across different scenarios.

Early activities introduced the importance of preventing numeric overflow and underflow, as well as protecting applications from buffer overflows. I also implemented an encryption and decryption system, which taught me how sensitive data must be safeguarded using proper algorithms and standards. Another key part of the course involved exception handling, where I practiced writing custom exceptions and ensuring that applications could gracefully recover from unexpected errors rather than exposing weaknesses.

As the course progressed, I completed larger milestones that tied these concepts together. I conducted a static code analysis to compare the results of Visual Studioâ€™s compiler warnings with CppCheck, gaining a better understanding of how automated tools can identify potential flaws before deployment. I also designed and mapped security policies to established principles, showing how organizational rules and technical standards align to create layered protection. The course emphasized the value of unit testing, and I developed a comprehensive suite of tests using the Google Test framework. Writing both positive and negative test cases with meaningful names reinforced the importance of verifying functionality and anticipating failure points.

In addition to hands-on coding, I completed journal reflections that connected secure coding practices to broader cybersecurity strategies. I explored concepts such as defense in depth, understanding attacker motives, zero trust, and the importance of building security into the development process rather than leaving it to the end. These reflections deepened my awareness of how technical decisions tie into larger security goals, risk assessments, and organizational policies.

Overall, this portfolio represents the knowledge and skills I gained in secure coding. I learned how to prevent common vulnerabilities, apply unit testing to validate code, use static analysis tools to catch issues early, and design policies that support a secure development environment. More importantly, I developed the habit of thinking about security at every stage of the software lifecycle, which is essential for building reliable and trustworthy applications.
